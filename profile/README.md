## 🧩 Overview  

**Keyboard Maestro for macOS** is a powerhouse automation utility that turns repetitive actions into one-click (or no-click) workflows. Build macros that launch apps, move files, paste text, control windows, type snippets, run scripts, and much more — all triggered by hot keys, typed strings, time of day, login, MIDI, USB device events, and even application state.  

Its visual editor makes complex automations approachable: chain actions, add pauses and conditions, loop over items, and branch logic with if/then rules. Power users can extend macros with **AppleScript**, **Shell scripts**, **JavaScript for Automation**, and URL schemes. Deep macOS integration, clipboard history, and palette-driven execution make Keyboard Maestro an indispensable productivity hub for creators, developers, editors, and support teams.  

Optimized for modern Macs, the app runs smoothly on **Apple Silicon** and pairs perfectly with hardware like the **Stream Deck** to put your favorite workflows at your fingertips.
